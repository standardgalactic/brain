This document presents a novel framework for understanding intelligence in terms of "Care", a metric focused on motivation, stress, and goal-directedness of agents. The key points discussed are:

1. **Cognitive Light Cone Framework**: The scale of an agent's goals and the boundary of states it can possibly represent or work to change defines its "cognitive light cone", which can be used to compare diverse intelligences.
2. **Two Distinct Light Cones**: Agents have a physical light cone (PLC) representing possible states, and a care light cone (CLC) representing their sphere of concern and motivation.
3. **Bodhisattva Vow and Bodhisattva Path**: The Bodhisattva's commitment to universal compassion and infinite Care can be represented by an infinitely expanding CLC, suggesting it as a path to hyperintelligence.

This framework integrates insights from biology, Buddhism, and AI to propose Care as a central invariant for understanding and advancing both natural and artificial intelligence.
